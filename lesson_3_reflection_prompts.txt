When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To publish the content of the local repository to others members of the work team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I can work locally with different files and I prefer stay up-to-date with the remote repository only when I finished my local work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a concept only for GitHub repositories. When you fork a repository in GitHub you clone it on GitHub servers.
    Clone is a broader concept. You can clone from a local repository to another local repository. You can clone a remote repository to your local machine. A Fork is when you clone a GitHub repository to another GitHub repository.
    Branches are used to label commits in a Git repository. We use branches to work with the repository but with differents lines of work.
