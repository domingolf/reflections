When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    To publish the content of the local repository to others members of the work team.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because I can work locally with different files and I prefer stay up-to-date with the remote repository only when I finished my local work.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a concept only for GitHub repositories. When you fork a repository in GitHub you clone it on GitHub servers.
    Clone is a broader concept. You can clone from a local repository to another local repository. You can clone a remote repository to your local machine. A Fork is when you clone a GitHub repository to another GitHub repository.
    Branches are used to label commits in a Git repository. We use branches to work with the repository but with differents lines of work.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    In this way you are "informed" of the changes that have been done in the remote repository. If you would have evolved your local repository, you could merge, or not, your local commits with the remote commits.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without Git or GitHub I usually create a centralized repository where the lastest version of the files and the previous versions of them exists. But you must be very careful to avoid errors. You must be very organized.
    With Git or GitHub everything is easier. The main problem is that you must learn the correct use of these tools.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When you want to issue changes in a specific part of the code of your project without influencing the evolution of the master branch.
