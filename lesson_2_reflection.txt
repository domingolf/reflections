What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	The metadata required for the repository is created under the hidden directory '.git'. This metadata is the information that git used to store the commit done in the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a set of files that you want to commit as a whole to the repository. All the files included in the staging area are in the working directory. Only a few/or one file/s of the working directory are included in the staging area.

	The value that offer the staging area is to commit more than one file in the same commit.
